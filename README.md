# Study data files

# Read the mouse data and the study results

# Combine the data into a single DataFrame

# Checking the number of mice.

# Our data should be uniquely identified by Mouse ID and Timepoint


# Get the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint.

# Optional: Get all the data for the duplicate mouse ID. 


# Create a clean DataFrame by dropping the duplicate mouse by its ID.


# Checking the number of mice in the clean DataFrame

# Generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen
# Use groupby and summary statistical methods to calculate the following properties of each drug regimen: 
# mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume. 
# Assemble the resulting series into a single summary DataFrame.

# A more advanced method to generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation,
# and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen (only one method is required in the solution)

# Using the aggregation method, produce the same summary statistics in a single line

# Generate a bar plot showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen using Pandas.

# Generate a bar plot showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen using pyplot.

# Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas

# Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot

# Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens:  
# Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
# Calculate the IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers.
# Generate a box plot that shows the distrubution of the tumor volume for each treatment group.

# Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin
# Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen
